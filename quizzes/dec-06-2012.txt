7.  52 million
    Well there are about 8.2 million people in New York. I'd guess the average person has a slice of pizza per week. There are 8 slices in a full pizza. So that's 52 slices of pizza/person per year. Which is 416,000,000 slices of pizza. Divide by 8 to get the number of whole pizzas to get 52 million.
